            <p>In order to provide the Services, we may need to disclose Personal Information. We may also share Personal Information and non-Personal Information with companies, agents, contractors, service providers, or other parties who are responsible for carrying out specific tasks on our behalf.

            <h2>Your California Privacy Rights
            </h2>
            <p>California residents who have shared their Personal Information with a business for personal, family, or household purposes ("California Customers") have the right to inquire whether the business has shared their Personal Information with any third parties for the purpose of direct marketing. In general, if a business has disclosed Personal Information, they are required to provide a California Customer with a list of all third parties to whom the Personal Information was disclosed in the previous calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed, upon receiving a request.</p>
            <p>According to the law, a business is not obligated to provide the lists mentioned above if it has a policy of not sharing a customer's Personal Information with third parties for direct marketing purposes, as long as this policy is clearly stated in the business's privacy policy and the customer agrees to the disclosure. However, the business must still maintain and disclose this policy. Instead, the business can ensure legal compliance by informing the customer about their right to prevent the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. Additionally, the business should provide a free and convenient method for customers to exercise this right. In order to avoid the sharing of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes by a third party, refrain from opting in or giving authorization for such use when you provide your Personal Information through the Services. Please be aware that if you choose to share your Personal Information with a third party for communication purposes, your information will be governed by the privacy policy of that third party. If you change your mind and no longer want the third party to use your information, you will have to directly contact the third party. It is important to thoroughly review the privacy policy of any organization that collects your personal information. This will help you understand how they will handle and protect your data.
            </p>
            <p>If you are a customer in California, you can request additional information about our compliance with California's privacy law by sending an email to contact@sharerapidly.com.Please be aware that we are only obligated to respond to one request per customer per year. Additionally, we are only obligated to respond to requests that are submitted through this specific email address.
