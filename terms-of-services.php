                <li>I solemnly affirm, with the risk of legal consequences for providing false information, that I genuinely believe that the material was taken down or deactivated due to an error or incorrect identification of the material that should have been removed or disabled.

            <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li><b>Purpose.</b> All disputes, as defined below, between you and Share Rapidly LLC will be resolved through individual arbitration. Arbitration differs from court proceedings in several ways. Firstly, there is no judge or jury involved in the arbitration process. Additionally, compared to court cases, arbitration typically involves less discovery and appellate review. The Arbitration Provision, also known as Section 14, will be interpreted in a broad manner. Despite any conflicting provisions in these Terms, Section 14 does not pertain to a situation where either party seeks to prevent the violation or improper use of their intellectual property rights, such as copyright, trademark, patent, or trade secret rights</li>
                <li><b>Definitions.</b> The term "Dispute" refers to any claim or controversy that is related to the Services or the Software. This includes but is not limited to, all possible claims and controversies. This includes (1) claims for relief and theories of liability, regardless of whether they are based on contract, tort, fraud, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal basis; (2) claims that existed before these Terms or any previous agreement; (3) claims that arise after these Terms have expired or been terminated; and (4) claims that are currently being litigated as a class action lawsuit, but you are not a member of the certified class. In this Arbitration Provision, the term "Share Rapidly LLC" refers to Share Rapidly LLC and all its previous and future entities, as well as its parent, subsidiary, and affiliated companies. It also includes their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. On the other hand, "you" refers to yourself and any users or beneficiaries who have access to the Services or the Software.</li>
                <li><b> Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator.</b> To initiate an arbitration proceeding, the party can open a case with JAMS, formerly known as Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (JAMS). This can be done by visiting JAMS' website at www.jamsadr.com or by calling their toll-free number at +1 833-233-4448. You can send any necessary or preferred notice to Share Rapidly LLC via email.
                </li>
